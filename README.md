# risk_dice_roller
A digital dice roller for the boardgame RISK so that we can go digitally random on rolls

I had a challenge from my kids to try coding up a digital dice in Python!
As we play a lot of board games I decided to pick one with the most dice and one that causes confusion for the younger on who wins and loses.

So here is it....

Simple single python file with all the logic as I am a script kiddy not a coder.
Single HTML render to show the options and present on the home network by Phone or IPAD format so its possible to have it next to us while playing the game.

Done using Spyder 4.0.1 (Python 3.6.9 64-bit | Qt 5.12.7 | PyQt5 5.12.3 | Linux 4.15.0-88-generic)

Possible GUI version to be done in Glade if I have the time....
